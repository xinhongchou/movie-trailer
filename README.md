# movie-trailer


I refactor the code a little bit:

1. Use Jinja2 to renderer HTML rather than embedded the snippet in Python code. Please install JinJa2 with the command below if you haven't.

    `pip install jinja2`

2. Move the CSS to its own file.

3. Add IMDB link for each movie. Navigate to its IMDB page when title clicked.

Run the command bellow to let the fun begin:

`python entertainment_center.py`
